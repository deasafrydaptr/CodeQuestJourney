# CodeQuestJourney

## Description:

Welcome to the CodeQuestJourney repository! Here, you'll find a collection of simple programs that I've worked on while participating in various courses. This repository serves as documentation of my learning adventures, from basic coding exercises to more advanced challenges. Join me on this whimsical learning journey through the world of programming!

## Contents:

- animalShelter: a basic front-end web project where I practiced building websites using HTML and CSS. I focused on implementing standard semantic HTML elements and structuring the website layout using CSS floats.


Feel free to explore, learn, and maybe even find some inspiration for your own coding quests. Happy coding!
